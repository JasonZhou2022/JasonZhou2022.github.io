						<h2>NES Zelda Dungeon Recreation</h2>
						<p>Controls: WASD for movement. X for Sword and Z for alternate weapons. Invincibility by pressing 1. Secret level by pressing 4</p>

						<p>I, along with my partner, recreated the first dungeon in NES Legend of Zelda. We both worked on different enemies and various parts of the game. 
							I developed the stalfos, blade traps, and gels. Additionally, I worked on the sword, bombs, animations, game physics with collisions, the 2D bow room, and, finally, the UI.
							Lastly, I heavily playtested the game, addressing the many bugs that were found</p>

						<h2>Rune Type</h2>
						<p>Controls: WASD for movement. Space to initiate Magic Circle.</p>
						<p>If you would like to look at specific parts of the world, you may press 1, 2, or 3 to go to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>1: Training Grounds</li>
							<li>2: Underworld</li>
							<li>3: Boss Fight</li>
						</ul>

						<p>I solo-developed a magic-based combat/puzzle system where you train on the surface and fight mobs when descending a dungeon.
							While there were many parts to this project, the most prominent features and gameplay programs developed were:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Magic casting system that displays a fun visual representations of casting process while also allowing players
								to mix various types of runes (magic) and their corresponding effects in real time (during combat), creating a dynamic
								and immersive combat experience that encourages experimentation and strategic thinking
								
							</li>
							<li>
								Physics and Collisions for the player, enemies, and boxes to allow for combat and puzzles-solving to take place through
								out the game world, assisting not only the magic creation process but also the exploration process and progression of game
							</li>
							<li>
								Diverse particles effects representing the four elements: Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth, adding depth, vibrancy and satisfying
								feed back to the player's experience
							</li>
							<li>
								Intuitive level design to ensure that no players were lost or confused while also giving them fun and interesting experiences
								while navigating the world
							</li>
							<li>
								Player onboarding to ensure controls were conveyed properly whether that be through the simple, but understandable user interface or
								through actions of various implemented NPCs to assist the player's learning and comprehension of existing mechanics
							</li>
						</ul>
